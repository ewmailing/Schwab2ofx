The files in this directory are random little tests/experiments of me trying to figure out how to write a working .ofx file that will import something reasonable (tested mostly with SEE Finance, with one quick try with GNU Cash).

Almost everything is copied directly from the official OFX Banking Specification PDF.

There is a lot of boiler plate, including Account and Brokerage numbers, which are taken verbatim from the OFX Banking Specification PDF. These are not valid numbers so don't worry, I didn't accidentally use personal account information. For SEE Finance, it gives you a drop-down to select which account you want to import to, so I never needed to fill in a valid number.
I don't even know where to look to figure out what the legitimate Schwab broker id is.

For new event types or trying to fix bugs, I recommend trying to write a simple test/experiment here (add to the directory), before trying to implement it for real. I probably should have wrote more of these.
