This is a simple web browser frontend to convert Schwab Brokerage transaction history in JSON format to OFX.</p>
It is built using Fengari to call the Lua library, schwab2ofx.</p>
Login to your Schwab account and download your transaction history in JSON format.</p>
Click the "Choose File" button and select your downloaded JSON file.</p>
This app will create an OFX file and save it to your browser's download folder.</p>
I wrote this because I was happily using DirectConnect/OFX at TD Ameritrade with SEE Finance, and then Schwab took over and terminated support for both DirectConnect and OFX. I learned Schwab killed these features for their own customers about 4 years ago.</p>
I was looking for some workaround. You can download Schwab transactions in CSV, JSON, or XML if you directly log into your account. I looked for other tools that could convert this to OFX, but the only one that came close was csv2ofx, but it doesn't support brokerage transactions, only banking.
I didn't know OFX, but I decided I would try to learn it and convert from JSON to OFX.</p>
I learned basic OFX and wrote the schwab2ofx library in 2 days, and spent another half-day learning Fengari and how to build this UI. So there is a lot of room for this program to be better.</p>
I tested this exclusively with SEE Finance, but it will probably work with other personal financial software that support OFX, such as GnuCash and MoneyDance.</p>
I tested with a lot of transaction types, including more exotic things such as options trades, short sales, and foreign taxes. But since I only have access to my own data sets and Schwab does not document their schema, there may be transaction types that are unimplemented.</p>
This is supposed to be a client-only application (i.e. this application converts your data directly inside your web browser on your computer and does not upload your data to a server for processing).</p>
This code is open source and also comes with a command line version.</p>
